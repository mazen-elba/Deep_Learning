## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
ANNs are models that are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks. They are a class of pattern matching commonly used for regression and classification, but are a subfield compromised of hundreds of algorithms and variations. 
### ANN Algorithms
- Perceptron
- Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
- Back-Propagation
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Hopfield Network
- Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)

## Deep Learning (DL)
Modern update to ANNs that exploit abundant cheap computation. They build much larger and more complex neural networks. Many methods are concerned with very large datasets of labelled analog data (ie; image, text, audo, video)
### DL Algorithms
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
- Stack Auto-Encoders
- Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
- Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
